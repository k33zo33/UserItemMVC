# UserItemMVC
This repository contains a .NET Core MVC application that leverages Azure Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database on Azure Cloud, to implement CRUD operations on entities such as User and a related entity, for example, Item. The application ensures data validation in all forms and performs asynchronous communication with the NoSQL database.

Key Features:

    Entity Types: User and a related entity (e.g., Item) with a many-to-one relationship.
    Azure Cosmos DB: Utilizes a NoSQL database on Azure for flexible and scalable data storage.
    CRUD Operations: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the entities.
    Data Validation: Ensures forms are validated for data integrity.
    Asynchronous Communication: Utilizes asynchronous programming for efficient communication with Azure Cosmos DB.

Getting Started:

    Clone the repository.
    Configure Azure Cosmos DB account and connection details.
    Run the .NET Core MVC application to interact with the NoSQL database.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the application based on your requirements.
