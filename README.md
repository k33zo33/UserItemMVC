# UserItemMVC
This repository contains a .NET Core MVC application that leverages Azure Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database on Azure Cloud, to implement CRUD operations on entities such as User and a related entity, for example, Item. The application ensures data validation in all forms and performs asynchronous communication with the NoSQL database.
